# Snake: Archived from August 2021

## Retrospective review notes taken from [my personal website](https://ahmeralam.co.uk/) (2024)
*Building 'Snake' was one of my early projects in Python using Pygame, undertaken while I was still inexperienced with making 2D games. Despite this, this project boasts some silky features such as smooth controls, dynamic graphics, and increasing difficulty levels. The project involved creating the game loop, handling user input, and implementing collision detection. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of game development basics and the Pygame library, laying the foundation for more complex projects in the future.*
